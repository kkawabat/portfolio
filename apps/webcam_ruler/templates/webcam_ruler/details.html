    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This app uses opencv to measure the distance from web camera to objects.</p>
    <p>See repo <a href="https://github.com/kkawabat/opencv_cam_distance_measurer">here</a></p>

    <p>Note: this app requires webrtc ICE/TURN server connections which I'm unable to get it working on digitalOcean
        server atm. However, this app was able to run locally if you decide to clone this website.</p>
