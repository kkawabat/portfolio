    <p>A webapp for making and recording sound to be playable on command.</p>
    <p>Set the output device and press a sound effect button to play audio from your speaker or headphones.</p>
    <h5>How do I play sound effect into the microphone?</h5>

    <p>currently you are able to play the sound effects into your speakers or headphones however my guess is that
        you want to play sound into your microphone to annoy your discord friends ðŸ˜ˆ</p>

    <p>Unfortunately there isn't an easy way to pipe audio into the microphone virtually through the web browser. So there isn't an easy way
        to make the soundeffect - discord connection (sad ðŸŽ»). However, there are 3rd party software that can help you configure your audio input/output
        such as <a href="https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/index.htm">Voicemeeter</a> and
        <a href="https://vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm">VB-Cable</a>.<p>

    <p> Voicemeeter is a bit too much to get into here but a quick and dirty way of doing this is to install <a href="https://vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm">VB-Cable</a>
        which creates a virtual "CABLE input" and "CABLE output" pair that allows you to pipe audio output device into
        an audio input device virtually. You can then set output device on the soundboard to "CABLE input" and then set
        "CABLE output" as the input device in discord.</p>

    <p>You can then change the sound settings of the recording device so that microphone is being picked up by the CABLE
        input and Cable output is being piped into your headphones. However, this will create a feedback between
        microphone to headphone.</p>
