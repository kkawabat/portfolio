### Introduction  
In Jan 2020 I signed up for a code jam on the Python discord server. I was put on a team with 3 other people with the goal 
of creating an app in a week where the only restriction was that it had to be built using [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) 
with the theme "ancient technology". We decided to do a morse code messaging app and we won first place in the competition 
beating out 18 teams. Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fbZsGrqBzo&ab_channel=PythonDiscord) showcasing some of the projects
(our app is shown around [9:04](https://youtu.be/8fbZsGrqBzo?t=544)) The app is also featured on Kivy's [website](https://kivy.org/gallery.html).      

One of the cooler feature it has was it's ability to listen to and live decode morse code messages, see demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcwQwayqzTg&ab_channel=KanKawabata).
