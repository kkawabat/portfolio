### Introduction
A while back I saw this [vox video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8O8Em_RPNg&ab_channel=Vox) about Magic eye images. 
This got me really into magic eyes for about a week and it made me curious on if I can make one myself. Doing some googling 
I stumbled across this [page](https://developer.nvidia.com/sites/all/modules/custom/gpugems/books/GPUGems/gpugems_ch41.html) 
on Nvidia's website describing the algortihm. 

I then implemented my own magic eye generator which you can now access [here](https://github.com/kkawabat/MagicEyeGenerator) on my github repo.
